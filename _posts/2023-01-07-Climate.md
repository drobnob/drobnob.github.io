## So You Want To Make A Difference When It Comes to Climate Change

I've Googled the same thing myself a few times in my life so I thought it might do some good to share what I've learned here. 

The very first thing that must be said is this: most individuals have very little control over climate change. 

The vast majority of emissions are the results of decisions made by multi-national corporations, countries, and populations at scale. 

The second thing to recognize is that the **systems we rely on today must change**. Short of revolutionary innovation that does not yet exist, humans must radically change the way we live and the systems in which we use. 

The countries, bussinesses, and societies that dominate activity in the world today (i.e. the Developed World) owe their begginings, rise, and coninutation to **fossil fuels.**

Without fundamentally rethinking our systems, all other efforts we make otherwise will fall short. 

### Steps you can take 

*I'll add to/ revise this list over time*

1. Spead the word 

This does not seem like a very tangible step to take - but it is. 

2. Vote

If you live somewhere were you have the right to influence decsions locally, regionally, or nationally - use it. Drastic policy change is needed to accelerate our transition away from fossil fuels. 

*Too be continued*

## So, You Want To Make A Difference When It Comes to Climate Change

I've thought the same thing myself a few times so I thought it might do some good to share what I've learned here. 

The very first thing that must be said is this: he **the systems we rely on must change**.

Most individuals have very little control over climate change. 

Short of revolutionary innovation that does not yet exist, humans must radically change the way we live.

Without fundamentally reimagining our systems, all other efforts we make will fall short. 

### Steps you can take 

*I'll add to/ revise this list over time*

**1. Talk about it **

This does not seem like a very tangible step to take - but it is. Talk with your family, friends, colleagues at work, whoever it is you speak with regularly. 

**2. Vote**

If you live somewhere were you have the right to influence decsions locally, regionally, or nationally - use it. Drastic policy change is needed to accelerate our transition away from fossil fuels. 

**3. Reconsider your diet**

**4. Travel & Transportation**



*Too be continued*

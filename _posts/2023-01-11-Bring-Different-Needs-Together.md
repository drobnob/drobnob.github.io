## Bring Different Needs Together

There are no shortages of changes society needs to make. Combating cliamte change remains the defining problem of our time but there are other pressing needs all around the world. The [UN's 17 Sustinability goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) is a good place to start. 

Three of those goals include fighting poverty, achieving good health and well-being, and building sustainable cities and communites. Many of these challenges are at their most difficult in the developing world. This doesn't mean the U.S. cannot be a proving ground for innovating solutions to these problems. 

Many rural communites in the U.S. are struggeling with these three problems. Economies and industries have changed in the 100 years or so since these communites were founded. Not to mention, national and global migration has drastically altered their demographics and politics. Remaining residents struggle with fidning and maintaining suitable employment, and therefore see diminishing health, poorer living conditions, and weakeing communities as a whole.

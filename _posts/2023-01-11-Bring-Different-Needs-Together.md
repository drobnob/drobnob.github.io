## Bring Different Needs Together

There are no shortages of changes society needs to make. Combating cliamte change remains the defining problem of our time, but there are other pressing needs all around the world. 

The [UN's 17 Sustinability goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) are a good place to start. 

**Is there a way to address some of these problems at the same time?**

I believe there are needs in some areas that can be met by needs in others. 

Three specific (but otherwise random) Sustainability goals are 
  1. fighting poverty, 
  2. achieving good health and well-being, and 
  3. building sustainable cities and communites.

Many of these challenges are at their most difficult in the developing world. But this doesn't mean the U.S. can't be a proving ground for innoative solutions to these problems. Many rural communites in the U.S. are struggeling with these three problems. 

Economies and industries have changed in the 100 years or so since these communites were founded. Not to mention, national and global migration has drastically altered their demographics and politics. Residents struggle with fidning and maintaining suitable employment, and therefore see diminishing health, poorer living conditions, and communities growing weaker as a whole. 

These communities grew and prospered from a system that is increasingly coming under fire. The exaustive nature of our consumption and consumerism is a huge driver of our fossil fuel usage. That system has also shown us that as resources dry up or labor becomes too expensive, capitalist fandamentals simply seek our cheaper labor and resources somewhere else. 

Developing countries and communites are desperate for the lifestyle the West achieved following this model. But we are seeing now how damaging it is to the world and that it offers no lasting promise of sustainability. 

Can these communites retool and serve as a new model for how to sustian?

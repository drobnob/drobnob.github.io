I am going to ignore climate deniers, but I did want to put something out there that might speak to them. 

Forget about climate, or weather, or rising temperatures. 

Just consider pollution and carbon dioxide. Is anyone denying that humans are expelling carbon dioxide in immense quantities? Current amounts per year are over 35 billion tons per year.

And we can measure the CO2 in the atmosphere. Which we do. And it's been going up rapidly.
